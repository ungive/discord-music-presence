**Music Presence** shows your friends on Discord
what music you are listening to.

It works with any media player, be that e.g. Spotify, TIDAL or foobar2000.
When you play music with an app, it is automatically detected
and appears in the tray menu, as you can see in the screenshot above!

These are some of the most notable features

- Shows the **correct album cover 100% of the time** for every media player,
  no missing covers
- Shows the exact current playback position, if the media player supports it
- Fine-grained control over which applications are shared and which are not
- The tray icon changes and reflects
  whether your status is currently active or not

## Features

- Music Presence works with **any** media player!  
  Currently over **70** different players are supported,
  you can find an updated overview
  [here](https://musicpresence.pocha.moe/)
  (this site was made by a community member).
  Adding a missing one is
  [trivial](./documentation/troubleshooting.md#if-your-media-player-is-still-not-detected)!
- Shows the correct album cover image **100%** of the time!  
  *This works with any media player
  and is achieved without the use of external image sources.*
- Fine-grained control
  over which applications are shared in your status
  and what your status looks like,
  including individual settings and the option to override settings
  for each media player individually.
- Perfect synergy with Spotify and the official Spotify integration!
  Podcasts can be shown in your status with the title "Listening to a Podcast",
  while the official Spotify integration doesn't show podcasts.
  You can also just use Music Presence for Spotify podcasts
  and use the official Spotify integration for music.
- The tray icon changes and reflects the current state of Music Presence,
  i.e. whether it is currently sharing media in your status,
  whether it's waiting for media playback
  or if it has been disabled by you entirely
- Always shows the exact playback position, if the media player supports it
- Option to switch between the player name
  and "Music" as the activity name with one click  
  *This means you can either have it show "Listening to Music"
  or e.g. "Listening to TIDAL"*
- You can also show paused media in your status for as long as you want.
  Offline media players get the option to show a playing and/or paused icon
  instead of the player logo
- Obsoletes the need for other Rich Presence applications
  and specific plugins for your music player,
  by giving you unified controls and customization for all media players
  in a single place
- In-app and automatic updates of Music Presence,
  so you don't have to install new versions by downloading them manually.
  In addition to that you're always informed
  about any changes and additions with an informational popup
- For TIDAL, Deezer, Apple Music and Spotify users:
  - Shows a "Listen to this song" or "Play on TIDAL" button
  - Shows all additional artists, not just the main one
- For TIDAL users: Shows animated artworks

*If you think a feature is missing, feel free to open

## Improving media players

Some media players report incomplete song metadata.
The following is a list of bug reports that were submitted
in order to improve what metadata these players report,
so that they can work better with Music Presence in the future.

- 25.06.2024&nbsp; [**MediaSession API does not report the album to the Windows system**](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/349310439)  
  Many media players are built on-top of **Chromium**,
  especially media players of popular streaming services,
  which unfortunately does not report the current album name.
  This affects players like TIDAL amongst quite a few others.
  Initially reported this to TIDAL [here](https://github.com/orgs/tidal-music/discussions/74).
