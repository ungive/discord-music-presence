# Contributors

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has put the time in
to contribute to Music Presence's development,
be that in the form of translations, adding features to the Discord bot,
making a donation, helping users who join the server with their issue,
taking the time to write up tons of useful macros for the bot,
testing beta versions of the app extensively, to make sure it's bug-free,
or moderating the Discord server and helping new users.

Without you the app would be lacking a soul
and I would feel much less proud of our community.

## Website with all supported media players

Thank you [@mercurialworld](https://github.com/mercurialworld)
for your hard work on https://musicpresence.pocha.moe,
a website that displays all support media players!
Thanks to you it's much easier to see which players are currently support,
without me having to manually update the supported players list.
This website is a life-saver!

Without you the bot would still be very basic in functionality.

## Translators

To this day, I am still flattered by the effort the translators put in
to make Music Presence accessible to a more users.
Many of you have driven me to add translations in version
[2.2.6](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/releases/tag/v2.2.6)
and since then you have been consistent with keeping strings up-to-date.
Thank you to all of these people:
